          This project is a response to the lack of transparency and justice in
          policing. The public should have the right to know which officers are
          patrolling their neighborhoods and watching their communities. When
          officers abuse their positions of power, they should be able to be
          easily identified and held accountable.

          It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was

          in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area in fall 2017 and in New
          York City in 2018. A Baltimore instance was launched in 2019 at

          can launch similar law enforcement accountability projects in their

      <h2>Press Release</h2>
      <p class="text-left">
        In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois
        nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched OpenOversight, an interactive
        web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public
        to identify police officers, including for the purpose of complains. We
        rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police
        officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to
        find the name and badge number of the offending officer.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and
        badge numbers of police with whom they have negative interactions using
        the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information,
        the OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential
        matches and, when possible, includes pictures of officers in uniform to
        assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by
        police," says Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead
        developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost never held
        accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct
        complaint, the burden is on the public to provide as much detailed data
        about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens
        with tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them
        accountable."
