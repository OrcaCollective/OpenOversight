              This project is a response to the lack of transparency and justice in
              policing. The public should have the right to know which officers are
              patrolling their neighborhoods and watching their communities. When
              officers abuse their positions of power, they should be able to be
              easily identified and held accountable.

              It is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was
              first implemented in Chicago in October 2016. OpenOversight launched
              in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area in fall 2017 and in New
              York City in 2018. A Baltimore instance was launched in 2019 at
              <a href="https://bpdwatch.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BPDWatch.com</a>. A Portland instance was launched around the same time at

          <h2>Press Release</h2>
          <p>
            In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois
            nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched OpenOversight, an interactive
            web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public
            to identify police officers, including for the purpose of complains. We
            rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police
            officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to
            find the name and badge number of the offending officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and
            badge numbers of police with whom they have negative interactions using
            the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information,
            the OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential
            matches and, when possible, includes pictures of officers in uniform to
            assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by
            police," says Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead
            developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost never held
            accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct
            complaint, the burden is on the public to provide as much detailed data
            about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens
            with tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them
            accountable."
