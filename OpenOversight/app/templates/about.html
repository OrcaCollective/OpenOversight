          OpenOversight is a Seattle Tech Bloc project that aims to improve law enforcement
          visibility and transparency using public and crowdsourced data. We maintain databases,
          digital galleries, and profiles of individual law enforcement officers from departments
          the so-called Pacific Northwest that consolidate information including names,
          birthdates, mentions in news articles, salaries, and photographs.

        <h2>We’re breaking new ground.</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://openoversight.com" target="_blank">OpenOversight</a> is the first project of its kind in the United States, and was first implemented in Chicago in October 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several instances up in other areas throughout the United States, including in <a href="https://bpdwatch.com/" target="_blank">Baltimore</a> and <a href="https://openoversightva.org/" target="_blank">Virginia</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>We’re proudly open source.</h2>
        <p>
          OpenOversight is released as free and open source software so others can launch similar law enforcement accountability projects in their own cities. The software is available for download and collaborative development on <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/OpenOversight">GitHub</a>.

          In support of demands for greater police accountability, Illinois nonprofit The Lucy Parsons Labs launched
          OpenOversight, an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify
          police officers, including for the purpose of complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a
          database
          of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number
          of
          the offending officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they
          have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the
          OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures
          of officers in uniform to assist in identification. "The deck is stacked against people harmed by police," says
          Jennifer Helsby, CTO of the Lucy Parsons Labs and lead developer on the OpenOversight project. "Police are almost
          never held accountable for misconduct or crimes they commit. To file a misconduct complaint, the burden is on the
          public to provide as much detailed data about the officer as possible. OpenOversight aims to empower citizens with
          tools that make it easier to identify officers and hold them accountable."
