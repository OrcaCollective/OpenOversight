      <p>
        The next step after a photograph of an officer has been submitted is to match it to the correct badge number, name, and OpenOversight ID (a unique identifier in our system).
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteers sort through submitted images by first confirming that officers are present in each photograph, and then by matching each photograph to the officer it depicts.

      <h3 class="mt-4">High security submissions?</h3>
