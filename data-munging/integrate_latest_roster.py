Roster update script.

This script takes the current list of officers from OpenOversight and the historic
SPD data, and produces the following:
- New officers (including and demographics where available)
- Assignments for all officers (this requires truncation)
- Salary data for the new officers

Since this completely reconstructs the assignments, **existing assignment data will
need to be deleted before this upload is run!!*
The following is the SQL needed to accomplish this:

DELETE FROM assignments WHERE department_id = 1;
DELETE FROM jobs WHERE department_id = 1;

Alternatively, if there are no other departments to worry about:
TRUNCATE jobs, assignments RESTART IDENTITY

This script can theoretically be run on future roster updates (although salary date
may need to be changed).
